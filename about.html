<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I’m a student with a strong interest in web development and a growing passion for building cool stuff on the internet. 
  I started exploring the world of code out of curiosity, and now I enjoy turning ideas into functional, responsive websites 
  using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.</p>

<p>As someone who’s still learning and growing, I’ve worked on small personal projects and collaborations that have helped me
   understand the real-world side of web development. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with design, and constantly learning
    new tools and technologies to improve my skills.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m focused on sharpening both my front-end and back-end development abilities, with the goal of becoming a full-stack
   developer. Outside of coding, I enjoy design, music, and exploring tech that blends creativity and function. I’m excited to keep 
   building and growing as a developer—and this portfolio is just the beginning.</p>
